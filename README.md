# Hey, I'm Michael 👋

  Solution Engineer at a stealth AI security startup. Previously at Akamai (via Noname Security acquisition) and
  MuleSoft.

  I like building tools that make complex things simpler—whether that's workshops that shorten sales cycles, connectors
  that bridge platforms, or internal tools that remove friction.
